This is a modified version of the official ROS indigo [naoqi_driver](http://wiki.ros.org/naoqi_driver).

This version has been updated to work with the QUT developed [MotionController](https://bitbucket.org/pepper_qut/motion_controller), which replaces the default ALMotion.move functionality.

**Note:** You can modify ./share/boot-config.yaml to enable or disable various features within the driver,
